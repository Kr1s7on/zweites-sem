Week 6 Practical test (40%)

80 mins, 15 randomized Short Qns (construct SQL statements)

Topic covered:
– Section 1, 2 and 3
- Section 4 and 5
- Section 6,7,8 (excluding Hierarchical Queries, Cartesian Product Join)
- Section 9 and 10 (excluding Set Operators)

Helpsheet containing SQL Syntax & Database Schema will be made available to students at BrightSpace for reference.

7. LIKE SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
8. IN SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
9. BETWEEN SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
10. COLUMN ALIAS SELECT column_name AS alias_name

expression 2 value to return if expression 1 is
not null, expression 3 value to replace if
expression 1 is null)

I need your help going through SQL basics all the way up to section 10.

I will prompt you two chapters at a time.

Provide me with real practical questions so that I get the hang of the different SQL commands.
