1. A process is a binary program in execution.

2. In a mufti-threaded process, information that is related to the process state as a whole must be shared by all the threads in the same process.

This is so, because to the user, the process is still one process, even though it has multiple threads all executing at the same time. 

Information that is related to a particular thread of execution cannot be shared as there are multiple execution engines, each represented by a thread.

3. 5 circles
    =start, ready state

    =schedule, running
        loop to continue running

        =interrupt, blocked for interrupt

        =blocked for reuseable resource, BREAK return to ready

        =blocked for consumable resource, wait for resource to be allocated, return ready

4. Process Control Block, organised as a queue in the memory.
