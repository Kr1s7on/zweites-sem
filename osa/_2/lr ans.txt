Intro to OS

1. From the user's point of view, the OS provides an env to run programs, and makes the computer easy to use and ensure effiecient operation.
    
    Given: OS allows user to interact with the computer such as browsing the internet, playing games, etc.

2. OS, Libraries, CLI, Compiler, Loader


3. No, because we need the OS to interact with the hardware.

4. Below
    a. Space-multiplex
    b. Time-multiplex
    c. both Space-multiplex and Time-multiplex
    d. Space-multiplex
    e. Time-multiplex
    f. Time-multiplex

5. Factors to be considered:
    • Amount of primary memory available (as a program and its data must first be loaded into primary memory before execution by CPU)
    • Speed of the processor (faster CPU can satisfy more processes per unit time)
    • Availability of other resources shared by the programs (e.g. printer, harddisk space, etc.)

6. Batch processing is the preferred strategy
    • for executing a collection of programs in cases where humans do not interact with the program when it executes; and
    • where it is important to maximize resource utilization. E.g. Telcos Billing System, Banks Cheque Clearing System
