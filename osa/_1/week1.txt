Windows CMD Commands

========================

cls - clear screen
md or mkdir - make directory
cd \ - change dir
dir - list all files and folders in dir

dir /w \ - shows less details in wide list format

ABSOLUTE: "C:\teststudent"
relative: ".\backup"

Use `Tab` to complete directory names.

"." - current dir
".." - parent of current dir

dir P* - to show all that starts with capital P
ALSO
dir P??????? - finds exact amt in string

=========================

Getting help

help | more
"help md" to help on the `md` command
OR
md /?  dir /?

========================

Internal and External Commands

- Internal is built into sheel itself "cmd.exe"
- External have own exec files

*Ext commands usually in "C:\WINDOWS\system32"

Qn: Are commands like cd md cls internal or external?
Ans: They are internal commands built into the shell or "cmd.exe"

=========================

Command history

- Commands are not case sensitive
- Commands exec are saved in history buffer
- `F7` for popup window on history
- `F8` search for matching command
- `F9` Run command number

=========================

Displaying messages

`echo` is used

examples:
echo hello
echo hello > hello.txt
`type hello.txt` to display content of the .txt file

echo off - turns off display
echo on - to turn on

==========================

Copying files and dirs

copy hello.txt hello.bak

`fc hello.txt hello.bak` to file compare their content

==========================

Wildcards in filenames

* - matches any seq of characters
? - matches any single char

`copy *.bak backup` to copy all files that ends with .bak to the backup sub-dir

===========================

Renaming files and dir

Renaming all .bak files to .old
ren backup\*.bak *.old

Example case use:

mkdir tmp
ren tmp temp
dir *.

===========================

Moving files and dir

=Move .old files to temp sub-dir
move backup\*.old temp

=Run to move temp to backup sub-dir
move temp backup

==========================

Removing files

Example scenario
cd backup/temp
dir .
del hello.old
del *.*
cd ..\..

Removing dirs

Example use case
`rd` is for dir, `del` for files

**Dir can only be removed if empty

Hereâ€™s the summary in plain text:

Input, Output, and Error Redirection:
- Standard input (stdin): Input from keyboard.
- Standard output (stdout): Output to console.
- Standard error (stderr): Error messages to console.
- Redirection: Changing where input/output goes.

Commands and Examples:
- Pipe output to another command:  
  dir | more  
  (Send dir output to more command)

- Take input from a file:  
  sort < data.txt  
  (Sort data from data.txt)

- Send output to a file:  
  echo hello > hello.txt  
  (Write "hello" to hello.txt)

- Append output to a file:  
  echo world >> hello.txt  
  (Add "world" to hello.txt)

- Input from a file and output to another file:  
  sort < data.txt > sorted.txt  
  (Sort data.txt and save it to sorted.txt)

- Send error output to a file:  
  sort no_such_file 2> error.txt  
  (Save error messages to error.txt)

Qn: File size of data.txt? How to account for the size of file?
Ans: 16 bytes. Includes 10 bytes of data and CRLFs
(carraige returns and line feeds characters)

- **Carriage return (CR)** `\r`: Moves the cursor to the start of the line.
- **Line feed (LF)** `\n`: Moves the cursor to the next line.

Windows uses both (`\r\n`), while Unix/Linux/Mac use just `\n` for new lines.

===================================

Redirecting errors

"type data.txt 1>data.bak 2> error.txt"
WHAT is 1 and 2?
"1>" redirects to the standard output. "2>" redirects to standard error

===================================

Redirecting to devices

redr not limited to files, devs also

Devices and Examples
LPTn (Output): Parallel printer (e.g., LPT1, LPT2).  
  Example: Sends output to a printer.
  
PRN (Output): Serial printer.  
  Example: Sends output to a printer.
  
CON (Input/Output): Keyboard (input) and console (output).  
  Example:  
  `copy CON new_filename.txt` (Copy from keyboard to file)  
  `dir > CON` (Send output to console)

NUL (Input/Output): Null device, used to discard unwanted output.  
  Example:  
  `dir > NUL` (Suppress output)

Qn: Which device CON refers to in the "copy CON new_filename.txt" command?
Ans: The CON refers to the standard input. It will copy the input from the keyboard to a file.

============================

Using multiple commands

abc1 & abc2 - run commands in seq - dir /o/b & echo end of file list

abc1 && abc2 - if 1 good, then 2 will exec - cd testfolder && nano module1.txt

abc1 || abc 2 - if 1 bad then run 2 - type no_file || echo file not found

() - group multiple commands - (hostname & echo running on & ver)

; or , - seperate command parameters - dir;*.txt or dir,*.txt


==========================

Grouping commands

Eg
(hostname & echo is running on & ver)

==========================

echo command

Special characters include the following:
< > ( ) & | ^
The caret (^) is used as the escape character.

==========================

sort command

sort command: sort [options] [file]
Sorts lines in a file or from input.
Example:
sort data.txt
sort < data.txt > sorted.txt

Options:
/r reverses the sort order
/+n starts sorting at column n

==========================

find command

find command: find [options] "text" [file]
Searches for specific text in a file or input.
Example:
find "hello" file.txt

Options:
/i ignores case
/v displays lines that do not contain the text
/n displays line numbers with matching lines

===========================
