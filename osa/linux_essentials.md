### introduction to linux
Linux is everywhere.

- **Linux Kernel**: Core controller of a computer system, loaded at boot.
- **GNU/Linux**: Combination of the Linux kernel and GNU tools, forming a complete OS.
- **UNIX**: Originated in the 1970s; portable and modular. Only certified systems by the Open Group can be called UNIX.
- **Linus Torvalds**: Created Linux in 1991 as an alternative to MINIX.
- **GNU Project (1983)**: Founded by Richard Stallman, providing essential free tools (editors, compilers) for Linux.
- **Key Point**: Linux is not UNIX-certified but is UNIX-like, combining open-source GNU tools with the Linux kernel.

More stuff:

- Linux is **open-source** and has **distributions**.
- Embraces the **CLI**.
