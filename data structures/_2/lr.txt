Corectness and Efficiency

Asymptotic Analysis - defining the mathematical boundation of its run-time performance

3 scenarios:
    Best case: min time. Ω(n) Omega

    Average: avg time. Θ(n) Theta, upper and lower bound.

    Worst: max time. Ο (Big Oh Notation) O(n)

Merge Sort with a running time complexity of Ο(n log n)

Insertion Sort with a running time complexity of Ο(n2)

    Merge sort more efficient than insertion sort since input size, n increases
